## üì®How Dynamic Updates Work

- After the script starts, a local HTTP server automatically launches (by default on port 8765).
- The HTML report (`report.html`) opens in your browser and automatically fetches fresh results from `results.json` every 2 seconds.
- As soon as a scanner finishes, its output immediately appears in the report ‚Äî the page updates **without reloading**.
